# PluralSight
JavaLists inherits from the collection interface and a collection is a grouping
of general Java objects.

A collection is an interface 
    -a blueprint describing the methods you must omplement to be a Java
    collection.

Subtypes:
    A list - an ordered group of values that are indexed numerically, and a set is an unordered group pf unique values.
    Java's nonabstracted lists:
    ArrayList
    LinkedList
    Vector
    Stack

 The Set interface inherits from the Collection interface,
 which is general grouping of Java objects

 You must implement certain methods to be a collection, like add, remove, size,
 and more.
 Most common that inherit are list and set.

 A list
    -an ordered group of values that are indexed numerically
 A set
    -a group of unique values without an index

The default sorting for strings is to sort them alphabetically.

A Map interface is an unordered group of key-value pairs.
Map is an interface, like a Blueprint, that says you must implement certain methods to be considered a Map
